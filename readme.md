# Tweet-Search

This is a simple app I did as an assignment for [Gomeeki](http://gomeeki.com.au/). You can search tweets about a city, which is then displayed on a Google map of that city. Each search is stored in a database for caching reasons. There is also a history function of all searches the user have made.

There is a [demo](http://map-tweets.herokuapp.com/) of the app and [install instructions and documentation](https://github.com/dan-klasson/tweet-search/tree/master/app/docs).
