# Tweet-Search

This is a simple app I did as an assignment for [Gomeeki](http://gomeeki.com.au/). You can search tweets about a city, which is then displayed on a Google map of that city. Each search is stored in a database for caching reasons. There is also a history function of all searches the user have made.

Install instructions and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/dan-klasson/tweet-search/tree/master/app/docs)
